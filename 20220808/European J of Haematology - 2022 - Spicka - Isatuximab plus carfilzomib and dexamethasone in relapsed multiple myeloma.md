>Carfilzomib 卡非佐米 is a type of chemotherapy drug called a proteasome inhibitor. It is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma.
>Carfilzomib works by inhibiting the growth of myeloma cells and encouraging them to self-destruct. Myeloma cells use proteasomes to break down proteins within them. Carfilzomib blocks the action of proteasomes, causing the proteins to build up inside the cells and the cells to die.

>#Isatuximab伊沙妥昔单抗是IgG1的嵌合单克隆抗体，靶向浆细胞和肿瘤细胞表面CD38受体的特定表位。Isatuximab结合在人CD38与另外一个抗CD38单克隆抗体daratumumab完全不同的表位。在不存在交联剂和有效的效应器机制（ADCC，CDC和ADCP）的情况下，Isatuximab对CD38 阳性细胞具有很强的促细胞凋亡活性。此外，Isatuximab可有效抑制CD38的ADP-核糖环化酶活性，机制可能是通过变构拮抗作用。Isatuximab可以在不存在CD38阳性肿瘤细胞的情况下激活自然杀伤（NK）细胞，并且抑制CD38阳性T调节细胞。临床前研究发现CD38表达水平与由Isatuximab触发的作用机制具有直接的关联，其中ADCC是最相关的消除血浆肿瘤细胞的效应机制。Isatuximab在非霍奇金淋巴瘤、多发性骨髓瘤和急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的体外和异种移植模型表现出强大的抗肿瘤活性。在多发性骨髓瘤异种移植模型中，额外加入泊马利度胺可以显著增强Isatuximab介导的ADCC作用和直接杀伤肿瘤细胞的作用，并增强抗肿瘤活性。
