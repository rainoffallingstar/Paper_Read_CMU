### BCR、BTK通路
- (9;22) translocation involving the ABL and BCR genes
- -signals generated by surface immunoglobulin (the so-called B cell receptor, or BCR). BCR signals flow through an intermediary called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) that ultimately contributes to the expression of genes that promote the survival of CLL/SLL cells.
 BCR-ABL fusion gene, which produces a constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase.
- the tyrosine kinase JAK2
- activating mutations in other tyrosine kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β.
- the BCR-ABL gene encodes a fusion protein consisting of portions of BCR and the tyrosine kinase domain of ABL. Normal myeloid progenitors depend on signals generated by growth factors and their receptors for growth and survival. The growth factor dependence of CML progenitors is greatly decreased by constitutive signals generated by BCR-ABL that mimic the effects of growth factor receptor activation. Importantly, because BCR-ABL does not inhibit differentiation,the early disease course is marked by excessive production of relatively normal blood cells, particularly granulocytes and platelets
-  JAK2 normally acts in the signaling pathways downstream of the erythropoietin receptor and other growth factor receptors. The most common JAK2 mutation, sharply lowers the dependence of hematopoietic cells on growth factors for growth and survival. This produces excessive proliferation of erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic elements (panmyelosis) 
- acquired mutations in MYD88. The MYD88 gene encodes an adaptor protein that partici-pates in signaling events that activate NF-κB and also augment signals downstream of the BCR (Ig) complex, both of which may promote the growth and survival of the tumor cells.
### 14号染色体相关

- a characteristic (14;18) translocation that fuses the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18 to the IgH locus on chromosome 14. This chromosomal rearrangement results in the inappropriate “overexpression” of BCL2 protein
-  an (11;14) translocation that fuses the cyclin D1 gene to the IgH locus. This translocation leads to overexpression of cyclin D1,  stimulates growth by promoting the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S phase 
- chromosomal translocations that fuse the IgH locus on chromosome 14 to oncogenes such as the cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 genes

- frequent translocations involving the T cell receptor loci and certain transcription factor genes, as well as mutations that inactivate tumors suppressor genes such as (leading to increased pro-growth signaling) and CDKN2A,which encodes a negative regulator of the cell cycle and a positive regulator of p53.
-  BCL2, a protein that inhibits apoptosis . One mechanism of BCL2 overexpression appears to be chromosomal deletions that lead to the loss of genes encoding micro-RNAs that are negative regulators of BCL2.

### RAS signaling
- rearrangements of the BCL6 gene, located on 3q27, and an even higher fraction of tumors have activating point mutations in the BCL6 promoter. Both aberrations result in increased levels of BCL6 protein, an important transcriptional regulator of gene expression
- translocations involving the MYC gene on chromosome 8 that result in overexpression of the MYC transcription factor. MYC is a master regulator of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), a cancer hallmark that is associated with rapid cell growth. Most translocations fuse MYC with the IgH gene on chromosome 14, but variant translocations involving the κ or λ light chain loci also are observed. The net result of each is the same—the dysregulation and overexpression of MYC.

### 细胞分化
- NOTCH1, a gene that is essential for T cell differentiation
- PAX5，a genes that are required for B cell differentiation
- Of particular interest is the (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia, which results in the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor α (RARA) gene on chromosome 17 and the PML gene on chromosome 15. The chimeric gene produces a PML/RARA fusion protein that blocks myeloid differentiation at the promyelocytic stage, probably in part by inhibiting the function of normal retinoic acid receptors. Remarkably, pharmacologic doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)

- a (12;21) translocation involving the ETV6 and RUNX1 genes, creating a fusion gene encoding an aberrant transcription factor

-  mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In such tumors, an “oncometabolite”synthesized by the mutated IDH protein blocks the function of enzymes that regulate the epigenome and interferes with myeloid cell differentiation ，Inhibitors of mutant IDH prevent the production of the oncometabolite and often produce remissions in this particular molecular subtype of AML
-
- acquired mutation in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF, that leads to hyperactivityof the kinase. This same mutation is found in a variety of other tumors, including hairy cell leukemia, benign nevi, malignant melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and some colon cancers .BRAF is a component of the RAS signaling pathway that drives cellular proliferation and survival, effects that likely contribute to the growth of neoplastic Langerhans cells.
