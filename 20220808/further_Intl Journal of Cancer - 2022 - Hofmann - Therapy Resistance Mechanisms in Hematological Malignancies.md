>#Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that target T cells to a chosen antigen and reprogram T cell function, metabolism, and persistence.1, 2 Through their extracellular domain, CARs bind cell surface molecules independently of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), in contrast to the physiological T cell receptor, which engages MHC/peptide complexes. CARs may thus target proteins, carbohydrates, or glycolipids and function irrespective of patient HLA haplotype. Binding to antigen triggers T cell activation, which is commonly mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of the CD3-ζ chain.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Merely providing T cell activation is, however, not sufficient to direct a productive immune response.8, 9, 10 The CARs that have provided tangible clinical benefits incorporate a costimulatory domain,11 which enables T cells to expand and retain their functionality upon repeated exposure to antigen.12 These receptors have been dubbed second generation CARs13 and are key to the design of persisting engineered T cells that constitute a “living drug” attacking tumors as long as they retain their functionality., #Isabelle Rivière, Michel Sadelain, Chimeric Antigen Receptors: A Cell and Gene Therapy Perspective, Molecular Therapy, Volume 25, Issue 5, 2017, Pages 1117-1124, ISSN 1525-0016, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.03.034.
